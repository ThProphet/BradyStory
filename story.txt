There once was a gerbil named farfel. He roamed the country side looking for honey to please his king. The great and powerfull Pooh Bear.
One day, on his quest to find honey, he stumbled upon a pot in a mysterious cave. The pot looked like it had a lot of honey in it. On the pot, there was text that read: "Take as much as you need, there will always be more in the pot. Take more than you need and succeed you shall not."
that honey looked so delicious he was very tempted taste it but at the same time, he really wanted to please the king Pooh.
Unable to make a decision, he waited too long and promptly died, as gerbils do not live incredably long. King Pooh raided the rabbit kingdom. 
The kingdom of Pooh decimated the rabbit kingdom. Peace was restored but only through war. Was it all worth it?
